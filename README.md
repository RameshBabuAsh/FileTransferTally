# Advanced File Distribution System

##  Problem Statement 
Imagine an IT administrator tasked with distributing critical software updates, project documents, or training materials across hundreds of systems. This process is often time-consuming and resource-draining. Traditional methods like shared folders and email attachments are akin to sending each user a separate copy of a giant file, one packet at a time â€“ it's slow, difficult to scale, and inefficiently utilizes network bandwidth. There must be a better way!

This project offers a solution to this problem by designing a path-breaking file-sharing system. The aim is to explore the intricacies of network programming and create a tool that is not only functional but also efficient, secure, and user-friendly.

##  Key Features 

###  File Distribution 
-  Initiate File Transfers : Administrators can initiate file transfers to a group of systems within the organization, streamlining the distribution process.
-  Efficient Network Usage : The tool ensures optimal use of the organization's network bandwidth, preventing unnecessary congestion.
-  Integrity Checks : The tool maintains the integrity of transferred files, ensuring that they reach their destination without corruption.

###  Group Management 
-  Create & Manage Groups : Administrators can create and manage user groups, making it easier to organize and control file distribution.
-  Real-time Monitoring : Real-time monitoring of transfer logs allows administrators to track the progress and status of ongoing file distributions.
-  User Discovery : Users can discover and join available groups, facilitating seamless integration into the system.

###  Security 
-  Controlled Distribution : Only administrators have the privilege to distribute files, ensuring that the process remains secure and controlled.
-  User Access Management : Administrators have the ability to control user access within groups, adding an additional layer of security.
